Freedom Love
I love my wife, my family, my dogs. I want to have nice cars, houses and travel all around the world with my wife. Spend my whole life with her and balance all the billions of dollars that I will have by helping the ones that needs help, life the ones that starves.
Also, I want to be recognized with my wife and family that we can do anything we want by using the power of the mind.
I want that me, my wife, my family (including kids in the future) that they never ever get sick. I love Lord Krisna.
I do love religion, but I think we're moving through their signs. I want $120 million dollars.
